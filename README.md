# Churn Analysis on IBM telecom dataset

### 路	Using IBM telecom dataset, carried out Churn Analysis and developed a ML pipeline for predicting Churn of a customer.

### 路	The dataset was split into two categories: Categorical and Non Categorical columns. NA values were filled using Imputer and Categorical variables were encoded using OneHotEncoder and QuantileDiscretizer for continuous values. 

### 路	Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were developed and a CrossValidator to tune the model with best parameters.

### 路	All the steps were added in stages to a pyspark ML pipeline and train and test dataframes were created.
